# TakeHome

Work was completed in 3hrs and 10mins.

I realized after the fact that an initial commit just with the project setup completed would probably have been beneficial. To explain my starting point, I essentially just followed the tutorial found here https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started. I started with just the bare next.js setup. There were no pages or components in place.
